The earliest form of the Diocesan Youth Movement was the 'Annual Anglican Youth League' which was started by Bishop Charles Hope Gill. In 1916, during the time of the centenary celebrations of the Church Missionary Society Activities in Travancore-Cochin, the missionaries felt the need of utilizing the creative and physical potentials of the youth for the glory of God.`;
